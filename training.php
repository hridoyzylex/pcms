We divide our workshop program into two processes. We arrange a <b>basic photography</b> workshop for all the new members after they get recruited into the club.
This workshop gives them the idea about the basic knowledge of photography. This workshop itself has two parts, technical and composition.
This workshop is followed a one day fieldtrip.

We also arrange <b>advance photography</b> workshop for all of our members. This workshop is a long processwhere a vast knowledge about photography is provided by
professional photographers. This workshop is conducted by professional photographers and senior members of our club. This workshop elaborates every detail 
about photography and enhances our members to flourish themselves into the world of photography.
