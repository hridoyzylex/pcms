NSU Photography Club is a student club of North South University. Since its birth in 1997 the members and photographers of this club has worked hard to expose 
photography to the world and amuse the world with the creative talent of the young photographers.

NSUPC was the brainchild of a handful of individuals who had the desire to make a difference.The desire to capture a moment of time in the form of a photograph 
was so intense that they had to make a difference which eventually lead to build this club no matter how many obstacles were in the process.Today 15 years since
our beginning,we have come a long way in these years. Our goal is to develop quality photographers and to establish a network between professional and amateur 
photographers.

NSUPC organizes many events, including but not limited to – national and international fieldtrips, photography exhibitions and interuniversity competitions. 
NSUPC’s biggest event – "International Inter University Photography Competition" is unique in the whole world and is the second biggest photography event 
in the country.

<h2 style="text-align:center; color: orange">.: Club Profile :.</h2>
NSUPC, as its motto says, is a major outlet of creativity for the students in NSU. Our goal is to develop quality photographers and to establish a network 
between established and amateur photographers. NSUPC started its journey in 1997, and within a few years it has established itself as an enormously successful 
and one of the most active clubs of NSU. The faculty advisor Shahriar Iqbal Raj helps us in every program to overcome the obstacles.


Although we are serious when it comes to upholding our goal of promoting photography, we are far from being a serious bunch of people. In fact we have a 
reputation of being fun loving at all times. The fun and sharing our thoughts makes NSUPC our second family. The respect, the relation, the love, the fun, 
the gathering, the enjoyment, the experience, the excitement all makes our club one of the most enthusiastic,creative and artistic club.
